                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Unfortunately, traditional banks can’t operate administrative tasks and
                        data processing as efficiently and securely as digital banks do. With the increased consumer
                        demand, more and more financial institutions resort to deploying technological advancements
                        within their product or service.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">In this brief guide, we will break down the shift to the digital banking
                        landscape and share the most recent trends in the fintech industry with you.</p>

                <hr class="mb-sm-5 mb-4">

                <!-- What is digital banking? -->
                <div id="anchor-1" class="mt-n5 pt-5 mb-sm-5 mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">What is digital banking?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Digital banking is a more advanced and sophisticated way of managing
                        finances that emerged due to the immense growth of the digital-only market. It implies that all
                        banking operations exclusively available only within a bank branch some years back became
                        entirely digitized.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Beyond that, the entire customer journey relies on artificial
                        intelligence (AI) to automate front- and back-end operations, from the subscription to a new
                        service or contract (online credit, savings, etc.). The digital transmission of all client
                        documents and the electronic signature at any subscription place is an integral part of this
                        process. This automation of all the bank services provides financial institutions, companies,
                        and, most importantly, their customers the opportunity to conduct wealth management services
                        faster and cheaper.</p>
                </div>

                {% include 'landings/includes/cta/digital_bank_small.html' with service='digital banking product' %}

                <!-- What is the difference between online banking and digital banking? -->
                <div id="anchor-2" class="mt-n5 pt-5 mb-sm-5 mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">What is the difference between online banking and digital banking?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">These two new alternatives to traditional physical establishments may
                        seem interchangeable, but they significantly differ.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">First of all, digital banks are most often accessible from a dedicated
                        mobile application, while online banks are available on any terminal: PC, smartphone, or
                        tablet.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Secondly, online banking is systematically backed by a traditional bank.
                        Even if it is not connected to a physical branch, an online bank uses the existing principles
                        and structure to offer a dematerialized offer of equivalent quality. Digital banks, on the other
                        hand, have to do with high-level process automation, web-based services, and APIs.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Last but not least is the time of processing. And it’s not just about
                        opening an account that takes a few minutes when you use a digital bank. All banking
                        transactions are processed instantly. This immediacy of financial services is something that
                        some online banks still need to deploy.</p>
                </div>

                <hr class="mb-sm-5 mb-4">

                <!-- Types of trendy digital banking platform products -->

                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">Types of trendy digital banking platform products</h2>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Native Mobile Banking</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Given how convenient mobile apps are to their users, banks developed a
                        native app to facilitate financial operations. They can be programmed from scratch with the
                        native code language and an intelligent ecosystem fitting the technical and user experience
                        frameworks of the device’s particular operating system.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">BaaS</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Essentially, BaaS (Banking as a Service) designates the banking services
                        which grant the use of their application programming interface (API) to third parties. It is
                        done to enable different players to ultimately manage accounts, issue cards, provide IBANs and
                        deliver other payment systems to their customers.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Embedded Banking</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Embedded banking is the practice of embedding banking tools in
                        non-financial platforms. Businesses implement it with the use of the Baas system. It allows
                        companies, brands, or retailers to incorporate banking software directly into their websites or
                        mobile apps with comprehensive services. They don’t need to redirect users to third-party
                        websites, which means a smoother customer experience.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Cloud-Native Banking</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">The following automotive and scalable trend is a cloud-native environment
                        in which IT guys build unique applications with the proper allocation of IT resources. And
                        although the cloud-native philosophy means the detachment from on-premises infrastructure, a
                        developed solution doesn’t lose its value—just the opposite. You have new services delivered to
                        the market in a much shorter time frame and of high quality.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Now comes the following solution: an instant transfer of money in
                        seconds! You can also hear the term “SEPA,” which signifies “Single Euro Payments Area,” a
                        single euro payment area that aims to simplify bank transfers and direct debit payments. Thanks
                        to it, individuals and companies can thus make standard or instant transfers and direct debits
                        within this geographical area.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Alternative finance has to do with emerging banking mechanisms such as
                        cryptocurrencies, Defi, crowdfunding, etc. Often, it is carried out with the assistance of an
                        intermediary platform. This mode of financing involves third-party capital to connect
                        fundraisers directly with funders, which in turn streamlines transaction costs and improves
                        market efficiency.</p>
