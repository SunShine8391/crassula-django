                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">What does the demand for digital wallets look like?</h2>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">To understand the context of the digital wallet’s take up and use better
                        and how massively it is adopted, we need to look at the numbers. The statistics below exemplify
                        the relevance of digital banking nowadays and what’s propelling its usage:</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">According to a global study by Juniper Research, more than five billion
                        people will be using a digital wallet by 2026 as “super apps,” driving adoption in developing
                        countries.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">As for the Marqeta new report, its respondents revealed that their
                        consumer confidence in mobile payments and digital wallets is so high that they feel more
                        compelled to leave the house with just their mobile device and are completely comfortable
                        without their wallets.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg"> Similarly, the growth of e-commerce businesses has accelerated over the
                        last few years, and the increasing number of users on PayPal serves as an example. The main
                        contributor to it is indeed digital banking, which makes products and services more
                        accessible.</p>
                </div>

                <hr class="mb-sm-5 mb-4">

                <!-- How to pick a trustworthy white-label wallet provider? -->
                <div id="anchor-4" class="mt-n5 pt-5 mb-sm-5 mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">How to pick a trustworthy white-label wallet provider?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">When it comes to launching a digital bank, a good start leads to
                        long-term success. A team of skilled experts to offer a custom-branded digital wallet solution
                        is highly recommended.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">With the provider’s infrastructure, you will save yourself and your team
                        plenty of time and a development budget. Building such a product from scratch may take up to
                        several years of coding, testing, and development while implementing a ready-made white-label
                        product requires just a couple of weeks. An excellent white-label provider will lay a solid
                        business foundation needed for your scaling ambitions and covering specific business needs.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">But here’s a catch. There are numerous fintech mobile app providers out
                        there that deliver unique solutions. So, how do you find the right one?</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Here are the main factors you should take into account when choosing a
                        white-label platform for your business:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Pricing: make sure the provider offers flexible pricing structures that suit your current
                            budget and not leave you in the red.
                        </li>
                        <li>Integrations: favor vendors with multiple integration capabilities and partner with leading
                            digital banks.
                        </li>
                        <li>Compliance: choose the provider that delivers compliant web, mobile wallets, and back-end
                            solutions with two-factor authentication, QR code scanner, multi-signature support,
                            institutional-grade security, or other relevant security features.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reputation: schedule a demo only with the providers with reviews and decent rating,
                            reliability is a must.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
