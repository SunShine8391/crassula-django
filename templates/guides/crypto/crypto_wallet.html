                        average of 3.9%, with over 300 million crypto users worldwide. The cryptocurrency market has
                        grown by leaps and bounds and is now considered an unquestionably valuable digital asset.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Traditional finance and runaway investors lured by generating large
                        profits from daily crypto trading seek different ways to take their relationship with
                        cryptocurrency to the next level. And finding the perfect wallet to store your crypto tokens is
                        the number one thing that anyone involved in investing needs to have.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">A crypto wallet is a ready-made white label solution designed for many
                        purposes, including storing, trading, exchanging, paying, and using existing cryptocurrencies,
                        as well as creating your own one. Having such a wallet allows a company to save time and money
                        needed somewhere else. There is no need to develop your own platform from scratch.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Crypto mobile wallets, in particular, are the most sought-after right
                        now. Mobile wallets support popular cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, DeFi tokens and enable
                        everyone to swap virtual currencies via Android and iOS apps.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">In fact, the advent of mobile wallets contributed to the effective and
                        frictionless management of funds. Moreover, traders and holders can also receive real-time
                        updates from charts and graphs, compare exchange rates and save the history of crypto buyers and
                        sellers.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-4 pb-2">Custodial versus Non-Custodial?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">After you get involved in cryptocurrency, the next thing to do is decide
                        which type of wallet to choose to store your funds. A custodial or non-custodial wallet? What a
                        dilemma. Let’s see what the exact difference between these two types is.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">All crypto wallets have a public key or a private key that allows you to
                        sign your transactions. Besides that, many wallets offer the possibility of storing this private
                        key in the form of a mnemonic seed, which is easier to remember or write down than a series of
                        random characters.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">A custodial and a non-custodial wallet have a very slight difference. In
                        a custodial wallet, it is a platform that holds your private key, while in the second, it
                        belongs exclusively to you. To be more specific, it is crypto custody providers, such as Bitgo,
                        Fireblocks, or Cooper, that hold the keys to a secure economy of digital assets.</p>
