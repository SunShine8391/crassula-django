                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">The crypto sector is now on the brink of mass adoption. Crypto payment
                        transaction value will surge 70.5% in 2022 to reach $10.40 billion, and by the end of 2023, this
                        number is expected to be 55.4% to exceed $16 billion.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Due to the high volume of digital transactions, crypto holders and
                        traders require a more secure, simple, and convenient platform to store their funds. Users want
                        to buy cryptocurrencies, wait until they hit higher exchange rates, and trade them on the
                        exchange website.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">This is why cryptocurrency exchanges are necessary in this industry. They
                        allow crypto enthusiasts to buy, sell and trade their cryptocurrencies instantly and with ease.
                        The time to build your own exchange platform is just ripe.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">In this article, you will find out about all the nuances of
                        cryptocurrency exchange and how to set up your own trading space with the minimum budget

                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">What is a cryptocurrency exchange?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">A cryptocurrency exchange is a virtual space in which exchanges for other
                        digital assets, such as traditional fiat currency or other cryptographic transactions, are
                        carried out.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">The objective of cryptocurrency exchange is simple: to allow the trader
                        to acquire or sell cryptocurrencies. They do this by converting fiat currency (real currency
                        backed by a government) into the digital currency of the user’s choice and vice versa. Some
                        players only take real money. Others only accept the digital currency. All of them charge fees
                        in one way or another, which is key to their profitability.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">It goes without saying that such exchange sites do not just provide
                        payment facilities but also pay attention to security and compliance. And that’s what the
                        regular user can’t make do without.</p>

                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">How to create your own cryptocurrency exchange platform</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Essentially, there are two ways to create an exchange platform: choosing
                        white-label products or creating the path for themselves. If you are bold to try the latter one,
                        these are the key steps you should take into consideration while developing a cryptocurrency
                        trading platform on your own:</p>
                    <h3 class="h4">Legal framework</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Studying all regulatory requirements is essential to guarantee the
                        security of your platform. Mandatory requirements in the vast majority of crypto exchanges are
                        AML (Anti-Money Laundering) controls and KYC crypto processes.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4">Liquidity</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Liquidity is an important determinant of cryptocurrency’s existence
                        exchange business. The liquidity levels determine how quickly and easily an asset can be
                        converted into another asset. If a market is illiquid, it can cause spikes in cryptocurrency
                        prices and, as a result, hinder trade execution.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4">Protection and security</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">A new report by Atlas VPN claims that the amount stolen by blockchain
                        hackers throughout the first quarter of 2022 is nearly $1.3 billion. Indeed, this profitable
                        industry is highly susceptible to hacker attacks. Thus, the protection of your cryptocurrency
                        exchange website should be constantly updated with innovative cybersecurity solutions.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">As you can already tell, manufacturing a product, which is a crypto
                        exchange in our case, is a complex process that requires a lot of capital and knowledge of the
                        volatile market. Moreover, building a basic cryptocurrency exchange from scratch also requires
                        time: at least six months for the platform itself and 12-18 months to deploy all advanced
                        features and implement regulations.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">As a brand, not everyone necessarily has the expertise and resources to
                        do it all. Developing a brand is one thing, and creating a platform is another dimension.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">If you don’t want to risk losing your investment and making a poor
                        quality or even faulty product, you need to consider an alternative: a white label crypto
                        exchange solution.</p>

                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">What are the advantages of a white label crypto banking platform?</h2>
                    <h3 class="h4 pb-3">Fast-entry into the crypto market</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Cryptocurrency trading is growing day by day, and there are more new
                        entrants, respectively. According to the Gibraltar Finance report, the market size for
                        cryptocurrency will reach $1087.7 million by 2026. A white label crypto exchange solution is a
                        viable way to get to the market promptly. It is a ready-to-go and fully integrated business
                        architecture that you can use and adjust to your own needs.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 pb-3">Enhanced Security</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">The most important part of an exchange is security. Unless your team has
                        cybersecurity experience to protect data during the transaction and ensure the customer’s
                        information is not stolen, outsourcing can be a backup plan. A white label partnership will take
                        over your exchange security.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 pb-3">An existing business expansion</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Many traditional financial or even non-financial businesses can upgrade
                        their existing infrastructure by offering quick and easy access to additional brand-new products
                        and services to their customers. For businesses trying to reach a larger audience, there’s no
                        better way to start than by partnering with a white label platform.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 pb-3">A catalog of solutions</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">You can multiply your sales force and boost income. Thanks to a large
                        catalog of the most up-to-date solutions, a white label partnership allows you to diversify your
                        offer. You will be able to announce new products that your customers hadn’t seen before, making
                        stepping into a competitive market more seamless.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 pb-3">Reduced costs</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">A White Label option is always cheaper than can build a platform from
                        scratch. Marketing campaigns or expensive infrastructure are no longer a burden for you. In this
                        vein, the financial benefits don’t go just to you but also to your consumers, that will
                        ultimately get more affordable products and services.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">You have the opportunity to set your own priorities and focus on your
                        core competencies, while a white label partner will take care of the rest. You shouldn’t and
                        can’t be an expert in everything. So, just keep growing the business, and operational and
                        compliance activities will be carried out for you.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 pb-3">Increased brand awareness</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">A white label cryptocurrency platform can integrate certain features,
                        tools, or metrics that are essential for your business case. In other words, it means that you
                        can fully customize it with a corporate design and a logo. Whenever your customers need trading
                        service, they will think of you.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Ultimately, white-label outsourcing has numerous advantages. Do not
                        hesitate any longer to contact a competent service provider who can deliver a top-notch platform
                        to you in the shortest possible time.</p>
