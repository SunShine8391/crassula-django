                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">In recent years, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen a staggering growth
                        in trading volume. Digital currencies currently play a vital role in the financial industries.
                        The number of cryptocurrency users is increasing day by day on cryptocurrency exchange
                        platforms. So many business people, startup owners, and entrepreneurs are willing to start their
                        own cryptocurrency exchange. Here, we are plunging into the discussion of white label crypto
                        exchange.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- What is a white-label cryptocurrency exchange? -->

                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">What is a white-label cryptocurrency exchange?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Essentially, it is a virtual space in which actions of buying and selling
                        cryptocurrency are carried out. It is also frequently referred to as a business that allows
                        customers to trade with stocks or any other type of financial asset.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">The purpose or objective of this exchange process is simple: to enable a
                        user or trader, to participate in a market in which they can obtain profits thanks to the price
                        variations that occur in it. All the digital assets are mined using the free market value of
                        each of them. And that is mainly how different parties reap the full benefits.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">The white label crypto software packages usually come with a set of
                        functionalities that can be rebranded. You can just enter the exchange market and effectively
                        present your own brand.</p>

                <!-- Main cryptocurrencies -->
                <div id="anchor-2" class="mt-n5 pt-5 mb-sm-5 mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">Main cryptocurrencies</h2>
                    <h3 class="h4">Bitcoin</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bitcoin is the first and most popular virtual cryptocurrency put on the market. It runs on
                            its blockchain with verified transactions that are carried out transparently and securely.
                            There is no official Bitcoin value. The law of supply and demand simply governs its price.
                        </li>
                        <li>For instance, after reaching its highest level in November 2021 at $68,000, the cost of
                            bitcoin collapsed by almost 30% in one month. Thus, it is safer to handle crypto with
                            third-party service providers.
                        </li>
                        <li>The most essential providers in terms of trade volumes are Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Kraken,
                            Kucoin, and others. Its mission is to protect you against an asset’s price reversal while
                            enjoying flexibility.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="h4">Ethereum</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ethereum (ETH) is just behind Bitcoin. It uses its own blockchain framework. But unlike
                            Bitcoin, ETH is not capped. It means that anyone can create an unlimited number of coins.
                        </li>
                        <li>Besides that, within Ethereum currency, smart contracts or so-called programs exist. They
                            entail codes and data that reside at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="h4">USDT</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tether is a stable cryptocurrency attached to an external asset, aiming to fix the price
                            volatility. Each coin is backed by an equivalent amount in US dollars, which does not allow
                            its value fluctuation as it t usually happens with Bitcoin or Ethereum, depending on market
                            supply and demand.
                        </li>
                        <li>Thus, Tether is an excellent option to avoid the risks associated with investing in the
                            stock market.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="h4">Fiat currency</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fiat money is the future of crypto. It is issued and controlled by central authorities.
                            Banks and governments restrict from gaining access to the growing digital asset class and
                            handle cryptocurrencies directly. This makes virtual currency less credible than the real
                            thing (hard cash or digital money in bank accounts).
                        </li>
                        <li>In addition, cryptocurrency is much more volatile than fiat currency due to the speculative
                            nature of the trade, where investors quickly focus on creating wealth by making profits.
                            Thus, if we are talking about fiat money’s prospects, it will no longer be replaced by
                            disruptive cryptocurrencies.
                        </li>
