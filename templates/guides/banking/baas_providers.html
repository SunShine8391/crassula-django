                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Studies conducted by Finder show that British adults that opened an
                        account with a digital-only bank equated to 14 million people as of January 2022. It is crucial
                        to indicate that this figure has not changed much since 2021. With such an increase in digital
                        banking activities, you might want to be among those who take digital transformation initiatives
                        as fast as possible and discover hidden benefits of banking.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">There is currently growing awareness that owning a Banking as a service
                        platform will play a pivotal role in the future of banking. Thus, if you strive to take
                        advantage of financial technology, this article will help you understand this emerging trend
                        better. You will find out what BaaS is, what opportunities it unlocks for the non-bank players,
                        how to choose BaaS platform providers, and whether it has long-term potential for the financial
                        industry as such.</p>

                <hr class="mb-sm-5 mb-4">

                <!-- What is Banking as a service? -->
                <div id="anchor-1" class="mt-n5 pt-5 mb-sm-5 mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">What is Banking as a service?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Banking as a Service (or BaaS for short) constitutes a business model
                        that enables existing licensed banks, insurers, and wealth managers to directly integrate
                        financial services and products into other non-financial digital platforms, most typically,
                        non-bank businesses.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Thanks to BaaS, any company that doesn’t have a license or expertise in
                        digital banking can actually become a financial institution. The cost of opening a bank or
                        creating digital banking services such as mobile bank accounts, debit cards, loans, and payment
                        services is sky-high. </p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">In this manner, companies often resort to white-label banking providers
                        that can facilitate banking products adoption.</p>

                <!-- What can BaaS providers do? -->

                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">What can BaaS providers do?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Banking-as-a-service platforms’ capabilities encompass a full suite of
                        products and services provided by the partner network, including sublicensing, IBANs, SEPA,
                        SWIFT, and other types of payment methods. Here’s more about each service:</p>
                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Sublicensing</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Obtaining a license takes month and involves a lot of red tape. Not every
                        business has time and funds to do that. However, there is an alternative – a competent
                        supervisory EMD agent that can grant an e-money license. Many banking software platforms,
                        including Crassula work together with firms and individual agents like that, releasing the
                        burden of paperwork.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Virtual/Real IBAN generation</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">BaaS platforms enable cross-border transactions with their IBAN issuing
                        capabilities. They provide the infrastructure needed to create both virtual and real IBAN
                        accounts with SWIFT integration. In addition to that, BaaS providers offer multi-currency
                        management tools to make operating in foreign markets happen.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">SEPA/Instant SEPA</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">BaaS providers simplify the international payments process by supporting
                        SEPA. Beyond that, your customers can make instant euro transactions that are executed in a
                        matter of seconds, thanks to Instant SEPA.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">FasterPayments</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Setting up FasterPayments is the next BaaS provider’s capability. It is a
                        very common way of making fast and reliable transfers within the UK.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Swift Payments</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Also, BaaS providers leverage partnerships with the leading banking
                        industry players, such as innovative payment processors, to implement SWIFT payment solutions
                        that offer the interconnected financial experience your customers demand.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">KYC</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">As a future company providing banking services or products, you must
                        comply with
                        <a href="{% url 'features:compliance' %}">KYC</a> regulations to minimize fraud,
                        corruption, and money laundering. BaaS platform providers offer an out-of-the-box KYC solution,
                        which is essentially a process of identity verification (ID card verification, face
                        verification, document verification such as utility bills as proof of address, and biometric
                        verification.)</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Card programs</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Merchants can issue personalized payment cards by partnering with the
                        FinTech platforms. Such card programs can be tailored in accordance with specific uses and
                        needs: financial management, exchange, deposits, payment services, creating loyalty, and so on.
                        Anyone can create a payment virtual or physical card virtual and link it to an e-wallet
                        account.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">FX</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Most BaaS platforms are FX providers that have extensive foreign exchange
                        offers for large-scale clients. Now, you can make fast and secure global transactions in the
                        currencies you need. Depending on the platform, you can access over 50+ currency pairs.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">BaaS providers are real game-changers for many businesses that want to
                        provide fintech products or services but don’t have the resources for it. Developing a new
                        financial product and bringing it to market means finding a bank partner, signing a long-term
                        contract, following compliance regulations, and then finally building that financial app or
                        service you were looking to offer to end users.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">If you aim to cut through the complex path of creating a financial
                        product on your own and differentiate financial offers in your product at an affordable cost, we
                        suggest looking for a provider. Don’t attempt to go off the beaten track. Instead, find a
                        platform of experts that can guide you through the complex stages of product development.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">The rapid development of the BaaS industry and increasing demand for the
                        banking platform contributed to the entrance of many new players in the market. Making an
                        informed decision about which BaaS provider is right for your specific business idea is probably
                        the most daunting. There are many providers out there, and every single BaaS provider offers
                        different banking features. Here are the key points to look out for:</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Diverse client base</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Nothing can tell you more than the client base of the BaaS platform. The
                        more diverse it is, the more likely the platform is versatile. Thus, search for a provider that
                        specializes in working with many different types of businesses.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">A range of products</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">You don’t want to hop from one service BaaS provider to another, do you?
                        We suggest finding one that offers a wide range of specialized, high quality products and
                        related services. Opt for a provider that has various offers designed to provide limitless
                        combinations. This way you will build a comprehensive solution with all the required bells and
                        whistles.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Regulatory compliant</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 pb-2 fs-lg">Regulatory compliance helps you protect your business’s resources. It
                        lays the foundation on which you build your company’s reputation. Respectively, choosing a BaaS
                        provider that complies with all essential regulations is essential.</p>
